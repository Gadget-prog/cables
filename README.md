# Some cables and adapters do not charge iPad Pro via Magic Keyboard
MacRumors forum users complain that some USB-C adapters and cables do not charge the iPad Pro via the Magic Keyboard.

Here is an example:

I have tried three different USB-C cables and they all show a "Not charging" message next to the battery icon.

MacRumors journalists confirmed that they were unable to charge the iPad Pro using Anker's PowerPort Atom and Apple's official USB-C cable. There are a few continuous charging sounds when connected, but nothing else. Some users are complaining about Anker and Mophie accessories.

However, the problem has not affected everyone. So it's not known whether it shows up on the side of what manufacturer: Apple or any other.

# iPhone 12 Pro comes with a three-time zoom and 120 Hz display

Famous blogger EverythingApplePro and insider Max Weinbach shared new information about iPhone 12 Pro.

According to their data, the novelty will receive a display with an update rate of 120 Hz. The smartphone will dynamically switch between 60 Hz and 120 Hz modes to extend the battery life where needed.

The second curious thing is that the 6.7-inch version of Max will install a 4400 mAh battery to also extend the battery life.

Also, the "pros" will improve the Face ID, not just make a smaller cut for it. There is no specific information, but it is assumed that will increase the angle of view of the camera to capture the face from other angles.

Well, one last thing. All iPhone 12 will receive a LiDAR sensor, as in the new iPad Pro, to improve the orientation of the camera in space and build a three-dimensional camera image and improve photo quality. Optical zoom will be three times.
